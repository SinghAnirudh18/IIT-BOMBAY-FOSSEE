# AI Python Debugging Assistant

A prompt designed to help AI assistants guide students through debugging Python code without giving away solutions.

## Files

- `prompt.txt` - The main prompt for the AI assistant
- `instructions.md` - Detailed setup and usage instructions
- `README.md` - This overview document

## Quick Start

Copy the content from `prompt.txt` and use it as a system prompt for any AI assistant like ChatGPT, Claude, or similar language models.

## Purpose

This prompt transforms AI from a code-fixing service into a learning mentor. Instead of providing solutions, the AI guides students to discover answers through questions and hints, building their debugging skills for the long term.

## Key Features

- **Guided Discovery**: Uses questioning to help students find bugs themselves
- **Adaptive Response**: Adjusts difficulty based on student skill level
- **Educational Focus**: Prioritizes learning over quick fixes
- **Structured Approach**: Consistent 5-step response framework

## Design Philosophy

The prompt is based on the Socratic method of teaching, where learning happens through guided questioning rather than direct instruction. This ensures students develop problem-solving skills and retain knowledge better.

## Success Metrics

- Students learn debugging methodology, not just solutions
- Improved confidence in approaching coding problems
- Reduced dependency on external help over time
- Better understanding of programming concepts
